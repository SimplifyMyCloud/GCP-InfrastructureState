## Desired State:

A GCP Project named `GCP_PROJECT_NAME` exists,  is a subscriber to the host `GCP_PROJECT_NAME` and is nested in the GCP Folder named `GCP_FOLDER_NAME`

The GCP Project `GCP_PROJECT_NAME` will exist in the Git directory for the production GCP Projects:

`/gcp-projects/prod/GCP_PROJECT_NAME'

## Current State:

A GCP Project named `GCP_PROJECT_NAME` does exist, the GCP Folder `GCP_FOLDER_NAME` does exist.

The GCP Project `GCP_PROJECT_NAME` Terraform code is in the Git directory:

`/gcp-projects/common/GCP_PROJECT_NAME'

## Expected changes to achieve desired state:

_NO Terraform state changes_

_NO GCP API changes_
