# Foundation Layer - Firewalls

Firewalls will be classified as either `internal` or `external` firewalls.

  * `internal` = Firewalls between internal subnets on a shared VPC or between VPCs.  Internal firewalls only sit between internal networks and never reach the outside internet.
  * `external` = Firewalls between internal networks and the outside internet.
